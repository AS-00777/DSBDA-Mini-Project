# 🎬 Movie Genre Recommender — DSBDA Mini Project

A **Movie Genre Recommendation System** built as part of the **Data Science and Big Data Analytics (DSBDA)** course. This project uses the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset** to analyze and recommend movie genres based on user preferences. It also features a draggable Python chatbot for interactive assistance.

## 📝 Description

This project follows the **Data Analyst Life Cycle** to analyze movie data, extract insights, and recommend genres to users. The system includes a lightweight frontend built with **HTML & CSS**, and a Python **Flask** backend that serves recommendation results via REST APIs.

A simple draggable chatbot, built using Python and integrated into the frontend, enhances user interaction by responding to queries related to movie genres and recommendations.
